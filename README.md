# CSharpFinalGame
This is my final project for C#.


This is a game that allows you to create your character's name and allows you to change some of the classes from the characters.

It pulls data and saves data to the same csv files to pull all the stats for the characters. It will then run until the monster is defeated or all the characters reach 0 health.
